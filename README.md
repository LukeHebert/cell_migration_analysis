# Repo description
I made a short script to help a previous lab measure the migration of cells with various genotypes. The cells were stained with DAPI and migration across a membrane was measured by a simple cell count. Because the data were not normally distributed, I used a Kruskal-Wallis test and generated a boxplot was generated to visualize the comparison.

At this time, I cannot publicize the inputs or outputs to this repository because the manuscript around this study has not been published.
